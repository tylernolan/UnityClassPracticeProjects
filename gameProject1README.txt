Menu:
A clickable interface menu that takes you to each game.

EGG GAME:
Multiple Eggs with different score values. Each egg spawns at different rates.
Eggs now use gravity and bounce off the bucket and ground using a custom physics object.
A sound now plays when an egg is caught.
10 Score maximum to bring you back to menu.

JUMP GAME:
2 different scenes.
One scene has a double jump, the other has a jetpack.
Both scenes have lava and ice platforms. Ice platforms cause the player to slide, lava causes the player to
hop (as if their feet are burning).
The jetpack scene has a changed scoring system. The longer you used the jetpack while in the air, the more points you get.
The longer you are freefloating (without using the jetpack) the more points you lose.
Score is also still added by height.

MARBLE GAME:
Added camera rotation using 'O' and 'P'.
A crazy, linear map with obstacles and moving platforms.
	The player must go through pretty much the entire level, leaving no stone unturned, in order to complete it.
Collecting gems no longer causes you to win the game.
Player must get the golden key, which unlocks the goal area.
Added gravity reversal, so half the map is played upside down. Added an additional killbox to compensate.
Added a speed boost as the final obstacle to get you to the goal area.
